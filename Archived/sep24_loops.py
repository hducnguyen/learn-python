# Ex1: Character pyramid

# Character to print: *
# Lines to print: 5

#     *
#    ***
#   *****
#  *******
# *********

# On each line:
#     1. Number of space
#     2. Number of characters



Ex2: printing diamond. Assume if the line is an even number -> add 1 to that

#     *
#    ***
#   *****
#  *******
# *********
#  *******
#   *****
#    ***
#     *


remainder == 0 -> even num
remainder == 1 -> odd

any number % 2 == 0 -> even
